      <p class="lead">Our team redesigned The Sancturary for Senior Dogs website because their website was disorganized and hard to use. our goal was to reorganize the website’s information to allow for users to use the website easier, and allow for more donations and adoptions. </p>

      <h1 class="display-4">User Research</h1>
      <p class="lead">We started with doing a Google survey in which we asked a couple of questions to gauge the users’ familiarity with technology. Then we conducted 5 user interviews to understand what users thought were most important to a non-profit website. 75% of users said they notice pictures fiest when viewing a website. 80% of participants stated that the donate button was the most important feature on a non-profit website. 100% of participants said that having their mission statement affected their chance to donate   </p>

      <h1 class="display-4">The Problem</h1>
      <p class="lead">The Sanctuary for Senior Dogs website exists to achieve the goal of allowing people an easier way to gain information about their company. We have observed that our product or service isn’t meeting these goals, which is causing lack of engagement and poor conversions on donation.</p>

          <p class="lead">We used card sorting to give us an idea of how we want the information architecture to flow. This allowed us to sort everything the website had to offer into a few digestible tabs in which the user could navigate</p>

          <p class="lead">My team and I listed out possible features that we should add to the website. Putting them on a matrix helped us figure out the crucial features that we should focus our time on. We wanted to really focus on a main catalog of dogs, a filtering section, and allowing a way for users to see how the process works. </p>

          <p class="lead">My team and I came up with preliminary wireframes for the structure of the website that way we could get a feel for what the website was going to look like. We wanted to get main ideas down without worrying about color or icons yet. We wanted to focus on the idea that you could view the available dogs, that way users could see and window shop. On the current website, you cannot view a catalog for the dogs.  </p>

          <p class="lead">The main focus of this website that drove the design was the idea of making the adoption process more simple and easier for the user to move through. This adoption catalog allows for a user to quickly see a dog and have a short description of it before they actually view it. </p>

          <p class="lead">Since my team and I have never adopted an animal, we thought it would be helpful to have a page explaining how the adoption process works. We wanted this to be given to the user in an easy to understand and digestible manner.  </p>

            Adopt a specific dog with 100% accuracy 
            Tell us the amount of steps in the adoption with 100% accuracy 
            Get back home with 100% accuracy 
            Find the eligibility requirements with 100% accuracy </p>

        <p class="lead">Further the donation flow and make it easier to donate to the organization
            More testing for a better understanding of our product and what we need to do
